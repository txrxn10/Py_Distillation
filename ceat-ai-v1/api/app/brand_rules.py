1.  **Logo Usage & Structure:**
    - [cite_start]The logo is a custom, hand-drawn logotype. Do not attempt to recreate it with a standard font[cite: 51].
    - [cite_start]**Structure:** The letters 'C', 'A', and 'T' are in Ceat Blue, while the 'E' is represented as three stacked orange bars that suggest motion and dynamism[cite: 9, 45].
    - [cite_start]**Clear Space:** A minimum clear space must be maintained around the logo on all sides, equal to the height of the top two orange bars of the letter 'E'[cite: 121]. [cite_start]No other visual element should appear within this zone[cite: 120].
    - **Usage on Backgrounds:** On dark or complex video backgrounds, use the standard multi-color logo. [cite_start]On very light backgrounds, the logo version reversed out of solid Ceat Blue must be used[cite: 170].
    - [cite_start]**Aspect Ratio:** The logo has a strict 1:4 height-to-width ratio that should always be maintained[cite: 146].

4.  **Cinematography & Visual Style:**
    - [cite_start]**Camera Work:** Must use angles that are **unusual and dynamic**[cite: 212].

    - [cite_start]**Logo in Band:** When the logo is placed inside this blue band, it should be positioned towards the right, with its height being 20-30% of the band's height[cite: 233].
